# CSES Repository

Find the problem set [here](https://cses.fi/problemset).

Use this template repository and Add it to your Repository. This is to have your solutions hosted on GitHub. Additionally, while starting, after forking the repo, add your name to this README file and send a PR.

Create a new file for each problem in your preferred language and keep the filename as the problem name. You can try out the same problem in different approaches and different languages if you wish to.
Preferably use vim as your text editor while writing code.

Commit and push the file once you pass all the testcases.
